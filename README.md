###### Problem 1
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a class (in a separate file, not in the program.cs) that takes in a string in its constructor
			<ol>
				<li>Create a private field of type string</li>
				<li>Assigns the string to the private field inside the constructor</li>
				<li>Create a private method that generates a random number, concatenats the number to the string in the private field and store it in a public property (meaning this public property will only have public getter and no setter or private setter)</li>

		</li>
		<li>Create an object of the above class in the main method of the program by passing string your choice</li>
